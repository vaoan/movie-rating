# Movie Rating Frontend
## Getting Started
### Running the React App Locally
1. Open a new terminal in the repo directory and `cd frontend`
- your path (`pwd`) should be **{system directories}/interview-pre-req-check/frontend**
2. `npm install --location=global react-scripts`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
- React app will start at localhost:3000
- Validate react app is working properly by seeing it state in terminal it has started and validate it is talking to your api by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/health` and seeing OK in the browser console logs

Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter any issues with `npm install`, try deleting the node_module directory and package-lock.json file in /frontend and running the commands again.
